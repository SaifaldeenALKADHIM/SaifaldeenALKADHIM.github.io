COMSOL Tutorial: Heat Transfer in a Solid Block
Objective
This tutorial will guide you through the process of simulating heat transfer in a solid block using COMSOL Multiphysics. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

Set up a 3D geometry.

Define material properties.

Apply boundary conditions.

Solve the heat transfer problem.

Visualize the results.

Step 1: Launch COMSOL
Open COMSOL Multiphysics.

Click Model Wizard to start a new simulation.

Step 2: Select Physics
In the Model Wizard, select 3D as the space dimension.

Under Physics, choose Heat Transfer > Heat Transfer in Solids (ht).

Click Add and then Study.

Step 3: Define Geometry
Go to the Geometry tab.

Click Add Geometry and select Block.

Set the dimensions of the block:

Width: 0.1 m

Height: 0.1 m

Depth: 0.1 m

Click Build All to create the geometry.

Step 4: Define Material Properties
Go to the Materials tab.

Click Add Material and select Built-in > Aluminum.

Assign the material to the block by selecting the block in the geometry and clicking Add to Selection.

Step 5: Apply Boundary Conditions
Go to the Heat Transfer tab.

Add a Temperature boundary condition:

Select one face of the block.

Set the temperature to 373.15 K (100°C).

Add a Heat Flux boundary condition:

Select the opposite face of the block.

Set the heat flux to 1000 W/m².

Step 6: Mesh the Geometry
Go to the Mesh tab.

Click Build All to generate a default mesh.

(Optional) Refine the mesh for higher accuracy:

Right-click Mesh and select Size.

Set the element size to Fine.

Step 7: Run the Simulation
Go to the Study tab.

Click Compute to solve the problem.

Wait for the simulation to complete.

Step 8: Visualize Results
Go to the Results tab.

Add a Surface plot to visualize the temperature distribution:

Select Temperature (ht) as the expression.

Click Plot.

Add a Slice plot to see the temperature gradient inside the block:

Select Temperature (ht) as the expression.

Adjust the slice position using the slider.

Step 9: Export Results
To export the temperature distribution:

Right-click on the Surface plot.

Select Export and choose your preferred format (e.g., .png, .csv).

Step 10: Save the Model
Go to File > Save As.

Save the model as Heat_Transfer_Tutorial.mph.

Additional Tips
Use Parametric Sweep to study the effect of varying parameters (e.g., heat flux or material properties).

Explore other physics modules (e.g., fluid flow, structural mechanics) for multiphysics simulations.

Troubleshooting
If the simulation fails, check the mesh quality and boundary conditions.

Use the Log window to identify errors or warnings.
