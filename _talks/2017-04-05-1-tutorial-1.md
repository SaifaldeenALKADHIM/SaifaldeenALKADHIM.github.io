In this talk I am explore the theories and techniques behind procedures of wireless controller system for mini CNC milling machine. The developed controller enables the machine tool to be controlled based on wireless communication and NC data generated from CAD/CAM systems. Then, a computer vision component using a web camera is proposed for the NC machine tool monitoring. It is explained the position on the machining table. The research consists of two parts. The first part deals with the mini CNC machine. This part is mainly composed of mechanical frame and DC motor for machine tool. In the second part, a new component that called “wireless controller system” is introduced. Designing “wireless controller system” will allow us to automatically modify NC codes according to the sizes of workpiece received from CAD/CAM system. This newly designed wireless controller system can be widely used in electrical and medical industry for making small parts and engraving small features.
