The talk is about Kesterite-based solar cells are becoming more and more common as the need for affordable and sustainable Internet of things (IoT) solutions increases. We describe the creation of an effective CZTSSe absorber layer with reduced V-oc loss and discuss its potential use in indoor solar systems. To accomplish this, Ag and Ge are co-doped using the double cation incorporation method. After co-doping, the devices were constructed and evaluated under circumstances of standard illumination (one sun) and low light intensity, which revealed improved device performances and decreased V-oc losses. V-oc of 290 mV under indoor lighting circumstances.
