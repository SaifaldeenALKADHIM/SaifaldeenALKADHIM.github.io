The talk experimentally determined how nozzles, water head, and discharge affect the performance of the Pelton turbine system. Different nozzles with various output sizes were examined. The Pelton turbine system was subjected to varying water head levels and discharge rates to measure performance changes. The results showed that nozzle size significantly impacts the turbine's efficiency and output power. Future work includes optimizing nozzle design for different operational conditions.
