The talk were experimentally determine how nozzles, water head, and discharge affect Pelton turbine system performance. diffrenet nozzles with output sizes were examined. The Pelton wheel tip and hub diameter has been utilized with various nozzles. Water pumps created pressure head and volume flow rate. For every nozzle, reducing the water head reduced water discharge and torque, braking power, efficiency, and rotational speed. Increased nozzle diameter increases discharge and decreases water head.
