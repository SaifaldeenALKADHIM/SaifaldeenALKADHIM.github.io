### Overview

The talk experimentally determined how nozzles, water head, and discharge affect the performance of the Pelton turbine system. It involved:
- Testing different nozzles with various output sizes.
- Varying the water head to observe performance differences.
- Adjusting and analyzing discharge rates.

### Experimental Findings

- **Nozzle Sizes**: Various output sizes were tested to determine their impact on efficiency.
- **Water Head**: The water head was varied to observe differences in turbine performance.
- **Discharge Rates**: The discharge rates were adjusted and analyzed.

### Results

The results indicated that:
- Smaller nozzles produced higher velocity jets, which improved turbine efficiency.
- Increased water head led to a higher energy output.
- Optimal discharge rates were found for maximum efficiency.

### Conclusion

The findings from this study provide valuable insights into optimizing Pelton turbine systems for various applications in energy generation.
