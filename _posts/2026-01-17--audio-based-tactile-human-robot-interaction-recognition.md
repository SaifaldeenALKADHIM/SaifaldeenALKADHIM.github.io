## Summary

This study explores the use of microphones placed on a robot's body to detect tactile interactions via sounds produced when the hard shell of the robot is touched. This approach is proposed as an alternative to traditional methods using joint torque sensors or 6-axis force/torque sensors. Two Adafru
