🌟 Excited to Present at the 2024 Academic Conference of China Instrument and Control Society! 🌟
======
I am honored to present our latest research at the 2024 Academic Conference of China Instrument and Control Society. Our paper, titled "A MEMS-Based Micropillar Ionization Aerosol Sensor for Precision Environmental Measurement", introduces a novel sensor designed to enhance precision and sensitivity in detecting particulate matter for environmental monitoring.

This research, conducted at the School of Electrical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, leverages MEMS technology to create a miniaturized, cost-effective, and highly efficient sensor capable of real-time measurements of fine and ultrafine particles. Our goal is to contribute to advancements in air quality measurement, with broad applications in environmental monitoring and public health.

The conference is an excellent platform to share our findings and engage with leading experts in the field. I look forward to discussing our work and exploring potential collaborations.

If you're interesting in collaboration, feel free to reach out—I’d love to connect and exchange ideas!
