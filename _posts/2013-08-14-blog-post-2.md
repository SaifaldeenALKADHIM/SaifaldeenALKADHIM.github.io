ðŸŒŸ Excited to Present at APET 2024 in Fuzhou, China! ðŸŒŸ
======
I am thrilled to announce that I will be presenting our latest research at the 3rd Asia Power and Electrical Technology Conference (APET 2024), held in Fuzhou, China, from November 15-17, 2024. Our paper, titled "A MEMS-Based Three Electrodes Ionization Sensor for Real-Time Detection of Transient Overvoltage in UHV Transmission Systems", introduces an innovative approach to enhancing the safety and reliability of ultra-high voltage (UHV) transmission systems.

This research focuses on the development of a MEMS-based ionization sensor capable of real-time detection of transient overvoltages, which is critical for maintaining the stability and efficiency of power grids. By leveraging advanced MEMS technology, we aim to provide a robust and cost-effective solution for monitoring and protecting UHV transmission systems.

The APET 2024 conference, co-sponsored by Fuzhou University and the IEEE Power & Energy Society, is a premier platform for knowledge sharing, collaboration, and networking in the field of power and electrical technology. I look forward to engaging with fellow researchers, industry professionals, and experts to discuss our findings and explore potential collaborations.

If you're interesting in collaboration, feel free to reach outâ€”Iâ€™d love to connect and exchange ideas!
