## Summary

Micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS) thermal flow sensors are increasingly used for compact, low-power flow monitoring in biomedical applications. However, silicon-based method for sensor fabrication is limited by high cost, rigidity, and multi-step cleanroom processes. This study presents a sing
