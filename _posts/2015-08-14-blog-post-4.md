🌟 Excited to Share My Work at the Micro-nano Device and System Innovation Forum 2024! 🌟
======
I am honored to have been invited as a speaker at the Micro-nano Device and System Innovation Forum 2024, hosted by the Chinese Society of Micro-Nano Technology (CSMNT) and held at the Golden Flower Xi'an. This prestigious event brings together leading experts in the field of micro-nano devices and systems, and I am thrilled to contribute to the discussions.

On June 23, 2024, I will be presenting my work on the "Development of Ionization Sensors", a topic close to my research and professional journey. As an IEEE Senior Member and IEEE PES R10 Communication Ad Hoc, I look forward to sharing insights, collaborating with peers, and exploring innovative solutions in this rapidly evolving field.

A big thank you to the Chinese Society of Micro-Nano Technology (CSMNT) and the organizers for this incredible opportunity. I can’t wait to connect with fellow researchers, engineers, and industry professionals at the forum. Let’s push the boundaries of micro-nano technology together!

If you're interesting in collaboration, feel free to reach out—I’d love to connect and exchange ideas!
