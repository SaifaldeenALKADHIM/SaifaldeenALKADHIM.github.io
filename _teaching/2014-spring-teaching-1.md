Course Objectives
======
The student will learn and understand
1. Fundamental antenna parameters and numerical methods to analyze and differentiate the antennas.
2. Concept of radiation mechanism of various antennas.
3. Mechanism and models for radio-wave propagation.

Course Outcomes
======
On completion of this course, the students will be able to
1. Identify basic antenna parameters.
2. Design and analyze antenna arrays.
3. Design and analyze wire and aperture antennas.
4. Identify the characteristics of radio-wave propagation.

Catalog Description
======
Antenna and Wave Propagation is to introduce to the students the basics of radiating elements and effect of propagation of radio waves in actual environment. This course provides students with comprehensive coverage of a wide variety of antennas and propagation topics related to numerous communication systems with a particular emphasis on military applications.  The course presents fundamental theory together with techniques for the practical design, measurement and application of antennas over the RF (radio-frequency) to millimetre wave frequency range.
