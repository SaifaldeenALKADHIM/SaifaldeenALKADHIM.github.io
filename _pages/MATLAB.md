MATLAB
======
The biggest technical difference between MATLAB and Python is that in MATLAB, everything is treated as an array, while in Python everything is a more general object. For instance, in MATLAB, strings are arrays of characters or arrays of strings, while in Python, strings have their own type of object called str .
