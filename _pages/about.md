I AM A PHD STUDENT AT STATE KEY LABORATORY OF ELECTRICAL INSULATION AND POWER EQUIPMENT, IEMIT,XI’AN JIAOTONG UNIVERSITY,XI’AN,710049, P. R. CHINA. PREVIOUSLY, I WAS AN ASSISTANT LECTURER AT THE DEPARTMENT OF LASER TECHNOLOGIES AND ELECTRO-OPTICS ENGINEERING, AL-FURAT AL-AWSAT TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY / ENGINEERING TECHNICAL COLLEGE FROM 2020 TO 2022. I OBTAINED B.SC. IN ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND M.SC. IN ELECTRO-MECHANICAL SYSTEMS ENGINEERING MEMS FROM UNIVERSITY OF BABYLON IN 2006 AND UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY IN 2017, RESPECTIVELY. THE THEME OF MY RESEARCH IS MEMS WHICH REFERS TO INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH STUDYING NANO AND MICRO FABRICATION BEHAVIOR AND PROVIDING ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS. UNDER THE THEME, I HAVE SEVERAL RESEARCH INTERESTS INCLUDING 5G ANTTENA , SONSORS FABRICATION, IOT SYSTEMS AND SMART SYSTEMS . I HAVE PUBLISHED OVER 5 PAPERS IN TOP-TIER JOURNALS AND CONFERENCES LIKE JOCS, SENSOR, IOT-J, ICDCS, IJCDM. I HAVE ALSO WON BEST PAPER TWICE INCLUDING ONE FROM INFOCOM 2017.

RESEARCH
======
The Internet of Things has a constantly expanding sensor node population, which causes sensory terminals to create a lot of data. Frequent data exchange between the processing units and sensors results in severe performance restrictions on the system's speed, security, and energy efficiency. A unique computation paradigm that can incorporate computer capabilities into sensor networks needs be created in order to effectively handle a significant volume of sensory input. 

Example for that we can combine independent components like sensors, memory, and computing units, devices are getting more compact. As a prominent example, the switch from conventional sensory vision computing to in-sensor vision computing has shown a number of advantages, including less data redundancy, simpler circuitry, and reduced power usage.
