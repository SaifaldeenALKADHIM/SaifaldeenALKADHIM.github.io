## About Me

I am an **Assistant Professor** at Xi'an Jiaotong University and a **Senior IEEE Member** with over a decade of experience in electromechanical systems, sensor intelligence, and global technical standards. My research focuses on the intersection of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), nanotechnology, and the Internet of Things (IoT). I am a specialist in the fabrication of Carbon Nanotube (CNT) and silicon micropillar-based sensors, particularly for high-precision environmental monitoring and industrial safety.

Beyond laboratory research, I serve as a key architect in the development of global blockchain standards, specifically leading frameworks for secure digital assets and e-Voting systems.

## Current Research Focus

The Internet of Things has a constantly expanding sensor node population, which causes sensory terminals to create a lot of data. Frequent data exchange between the processing units and sensors results in severe performance restrictions on the system's speed, security, and energy efficiency. A unique computation paradigm that can incorporate computer capabilities into sensor networks needs be created in order to effectively handle a significant volume of sensory input.

By combining independent components like sensors, memory, and computing units, devices are getting more compact. As a prominent example, the switch from conventional sensory vision computing to in-sensor vision computing has shown a number of advantages, including less data redundancy, simpler circuitry, and reduced power usage.
