A Research engineer at State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, IEMIT, Xi'An Jiaotong University, Xi'An,710049, P. R. China. Previously, I was an assistant lecturer at the department of laser technologies and electro-optics engineering, Al-Furat Al-Awsat Technical University / Engineering Technical College, from 2020 to 2022. I obtained a BSc in electrical engineering and a M.Sc. in Electro-Mechanical Systems Engineering (MEMS) from the University of Babylon in 2006 and the University of Technology in 2017, respectively. The theme of my research is MEMS, which refers to interdisciplinary research studying nano and microfabrication behaviour and providing actionable insights. Under the theme, I have several research interests, including 5g antennas, sensor fabrication, IoT systems, and smart systems. I have published over five papers in top-tier journals and conferences like JOCM, JPCS, ICCAD, UKSim-AMSS, and IJCDS. I have also won the best paper award twice, including once from UKSim-AMSS 2017.

RESEARCH
======
Saif Aldeen Saad Obayes Al-Kadhim is a dedicated researcher specializing in sensor and MEMS technologies, IoT solutions, and advanced electronic systems, currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at Xiâ€™an Jiaotong University. His research focuses on developing cutting-edge sensing technologies for industrial and environmental applications, evidenced by his participation in three national and provincial R&D projects, including the National Key R&D Program (2022YFB3206803) on trace gas detection and the High Sensitivity Aerosol and Pressure Sensor Research (2021YFB2012501) for environmental monitoring, with cumulative funding exceeding 8.58 million RMB. Proficient in MEMS design, PCB layout (Altium Designer), and simulation tools (COMSOL, ANSYS), he has authored multiple peer-reviewed publications on ionization-based aerosol sensors, humidity sensing innovations, and IoT-driven industrial monitoring systems. His technical expertise is complemented by project management credentials (PMP, Agile) and leadership roles in IEEE committees, including Vice Chair of the P2418.11 Standards Committee and China Representative for PESDay24. Through interdisciplinary collaboration and a strong emphasis on practical applications, his work bridges advanced sensor development with industrial IoT integration, aiming to enhance efficiency and safety in energy systems and smart manufacturing. 

Example for that we can combine independent components like sensors, memory, and computing units, devices are getting more compact. As a prominent example, the switch from conventional sensory vision computing to in-sensor vision computing has shown a number of advantages, including less data redundancy, simpler circuitry, and reduced power usage.
