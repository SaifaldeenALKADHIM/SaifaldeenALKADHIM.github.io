MATLAB
======
The biggest technical difference between MATLAB and Python is that in MATLAB, everything is treated as an array, while in Python everything is a more general object. For instance, in MATLAB, strings are arrays of characters or arrays of strings, while in Python, strings have their own type of object called str .


RESEARCH
======
The Internet of Things has a constantly expanding sensor node population, which causes sensory terminals to create a lot of data. Frequent data exchange between the processing units and sensors results in severe performance restrictions on the system's speed, security, and energy efficiency. A unique computation paradigm that can incorporate computer capabilities into sensor networks needs be created in order to effectively handle a significant volume of sensory input. 

Example for that we can combine independent components like sensors, memory, and computing units, devices are getting more compact. As a prominent example, the switch from conventional sensory vision computing to in-sensor vision computing has shown a number of advantages, including less data redundancy, simpler circuitry, and reduced power usage.
