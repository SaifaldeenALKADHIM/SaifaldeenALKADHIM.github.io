## Summary

This publication presents a novel triple-electrode ionization sensor design utilizing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for ultra-sensitive humidity sensing. The sensor achieves unprecedented performance metrics with a sensitivity of **381.67 %RH⁻¹** in nitrogen environments and **11.83 %RH⁻¹** in air, making it significantly more sensitive than conventional humidity sensors.

### Key Contributions:

**Advanced Design:** Triple-electrode configuration with CNT integration enables precise electron distribution and ion concentration control.

**Performance Metrics:**
- Sensitivity: 381.67 %RH⁻¹ (nitrogen), 11.83 %RH⁻¹ (air)
- Detection Range: 25.8–100% RH (nitrogen), 30–100% RH (air)  
- Response Time: 11 seconds
- Recovery Time: 5 seconds

**Applications:** Food processing, healthcare monitoring, electronic manufacturing, environmental control systems, and industrial safety applications requiring high-precision humidity measurement.

### Technical Innovation:

The integration of carbon nanotubes with the ionization principle leverages the large surface area and exceptional adsorption properties of CNTs combined with the exponential relationship between collecting current and relative humidity, resulting in superior performance across diverse environments.
